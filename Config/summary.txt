 Hi, I'm Azman, a 3D artist with 6+ years in the gaming industry. I've 
collaborated with various studios, specializing in asset creation and rendering 
using Substance Painter, ZBrush, Blender, Unity, Unreal engine and Photoshop. 
My expertise includes crafting characters and props for games and animations, 
excelling in high-quality maps and efficient UV mapping. I bring a keen artistic 
eye to projects, focusing on composition, realism, texture, color, and lighting. 
Alongside my creativity, I offer strong communication, teamwork, and time 
management skills. Excited to contribute my experience to new projects!
